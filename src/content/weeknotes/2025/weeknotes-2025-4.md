Over the past months since I have been here in France I have become increasingly distracted with things on my computer: websites, apps, things on my phone, things that get in the way of me getting things done.

So I have set about starting to remove or reduce many of them.

## Things that I have done

### Websites

Websites that I regularly go to when I am bored are now blocked by a Chrome extension called
[Web Site Blocker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-site-blocker/aoabjfoanlljmgnohepbkimcekolejjn). I am sure there are others out there but this one allows me to block any website that I want.

### Phone

On my phone I regularly used to check email super mega often. Multiple times per hour. So I logged out of the email in the browser. This means that if I need to check my email I can do it on my computer, or if I _really_ need to I can grab the password and log in again. This added friction means that I no longer check the email every five minutes when I am on my phone bored.

### Listening to Podcasts

I have always wanted to get into podcasts and have a huge collection of podcasts that I am subscribed to but never get around to actually listening to them. I have changed that this week but putting the podcast on in the background when I am doing chores around the house. I don't need to listen to them with headphones in when I am in a particular place but can do it anywhere. Have listened to a few this week and really enjoying the new habit!

### Setting a timer to do things

I have been experimenting with using timers to enclose my time better. So far I have been using a 45 minutes timer to do some work, or some French learning. Once the timer runs out I get the chance to do something other than being in front of my computer, such as stretching, making a cup of tea, doing Duolingo on my phone, listening to a podcast, or getting some fresh air. I'll have 15 minutes for this then back to the next 45minute block.

I will try out different combinations such as 25:5 next to see if it makes any difference.

## Writing things down to see how far I have come

This week I have started to write things down on a Field Notes notebook to record what key things I have done. The presence of the items on the list grows daily and the satisfaction grows daily as I record new things and see what I have done since the start of writing this list. It is inspiring to do this and encourages me to go forward and do even more!

## Standing desk

Since working remotely at Venture Harbour I have had a standing desk but for the most time I have not used the desk to stand. I'd try it for a bit and have painful back and legs and give up.
Not this time! I have kept the desk in the standing configuration and not restored it to the sitting mode at all for three weeks. The chair sits under the desk, or in the corner of the room.

## Exercise

Obvious really but doing something every day after I drop off the kids at school has really improved my mental state.

## Water

Since being here in Grenoble for whatever reason I have not drunk enough water. That has to change and I am now starting to carry around a water bottle when I am in the house and one in my rucsac when I go out.
