If I were to write a long story that could go onto things and then carry on until things were even then what would happen? Would I go crazy and roll over into a ditch take off my clothes and call the people in white coats, or do something normal like going to the café and order a tasty flat white?

Friday evening and I am now listening to [Télépopmusik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9popmusik) on the hifi. Connected my ancient CD player once I found that we did have a Toslink cable and micro adaptor for the amp. I connected it this afternoon and after figuring out that the lens on the CD player was most probably dirty and that it would sometimes not be able to read the CD and not play the CD in this case.

Well. I now own a radioactive Orange writing pen! It is even brighter than my bright orange Field Notes that arrived this week. I am very happy that I have now chosen <span style={`color: ${radioactiveOrange}`}>orange</span> as my colour. Makes things simpler!

Sitting in Costa Café in Didcot sipping from a bucket size black Americano and contemplating life would probably sum up my day. I really like the look and feel of this typeface for the copy, not overly sure about the typeface for the headings but I can work on that later.

It would really be amazing if I had some music to listen to as there is so much noise in this place. Outdoors it is raining and people have flooded in and as I am sitting close to the till and next to the kitchen it is even louder here. This vantage point does give me a view over the whole café so I must not complain too much.

I am continually distracted from writing by tinkering with the style of the code. I wonder how it might be possible to enable custom styling in a .mdx or .md file? Yes it turns out. I have turned this file into a .mdx and can `import './style.css` under the front-matter. After I resolved that issue I could then go home via the Petrol station.

The speed limit between Didcot and Wallingford has been reduced to be 40 all the way. Obviously this is good for safety of cyclists and other cars but it takes bloody ages to get from one to the other.

I just want to write without the distractions of too much shit going on.

I want to go to the shops, to Didcot, and then have a coffee in a cafe.

## Things still to do

## Plan for Shit to get done

Make stuff cool again. Then get a job that I like with more holiday and doing something interesting that challenges and provides value for real fucking people.

Then I want to go on a nice long bike ride and relax the hell out.

I think that working somewhere not at home at least one day of the week is extremely valuable for mental health and wellbeing.

Remove the distractions. Remove the routine. Change the font, remove the styles. Get going from the ground up.

## Stuff that still needs to be designed up

1. [x] Code Samples
1. [x] `BlankSpace` component for spacing things.
1. [x] `Columns` component for spacing things.

<Code
  code={`const thing = 'thing';
`}
  lang="ts"
  theme="synthwave-84"
