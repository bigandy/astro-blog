            This site was created with Zed and strong black coffee, with Astro
            as the framework of choice with a bit of Svelte (for the bookshelf)
            but mostly vanilla html and css using markdown to write the blog
            posts and articles.
        </p>

        <h2>Latest Blog Posts</h2>
        <BlogPostList number={9} />
