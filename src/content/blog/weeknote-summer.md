Been in Grenoble almost 10 months now and have experienced our first canicule which was ok for the first two weeks until it wasn't as the weather got hotter and hotter and sleeping became more difficult and then you get the cumulative lack of sleep and tiredness from that.

Today the weather is actually below "average" for this time of year (Juillet). Average being a max of 29C and min of 16C. Todays forecast stats are 27C (max) / 10C (min).

## School

Last Friday was the final day of the kids first year at l'Ã©cole primaire.

## Best things of last 10 months here

- Weather is generally better with warmer days and much less rain.
- Sunshine and blue skies are a daily occurrance not an exception like in the UK.
- Surrounding beauty. We are extremely lucky to be surrounded by the French Alps and we can go every weekend for hikes or skiing or to a Lake to cool off.
- Cycling is tough but worth it. Mountains and cycling. Need to go out more!
- Food and drink is good.
- People are really nice.

## Worst things in last 10 months here

- Mosquitos
- Crime (living in a city has been a slight shock to us all, expecially initially)
- Difficulty of finding a job. Still looking!
