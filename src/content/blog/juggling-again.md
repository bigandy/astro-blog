I first started juggling when I was in my final year of university after I had joined the University of Manchester Canoe Club. One of the other members - Nick - was a keen juggler and on canoeing trips he took his juggling balls. I wanted to know how to do it and when I went home for the Christmas holidays I taught myself how to do it. Just three balls to begin with. 

I made some more juggling balls with dried lentals in the middle. I made a bag to hold the juggling balls and bought more. The bag is still going after all these years! I even made myself some juggling clubs out of newspaper and cellotape. I joined several juggling clubs and went to some juggling conventions.

Over the years I got better and better, going from three balls to four and even to five also learning how to juggle clubs and other related skills such as poi, the diabolo and devils sticks to lesser extents. 

I was passionate about juggling but then I stopped. Life happened and I moved on to other things. It has been about 20 years since I seriously did any practice. I kept the juggling balls but never had a motivation to practice for long.

That changed yesterday when I remembered that I had a set of balls and I got them out and started practicing. My children saw me practicing and the boy started practicing next to me: how to throw and catch, starting the long journey to mastery if he chooses. 

Personally I started recording new records of how many catches of various patterns I could do. Building up the levels of skill, accuracy, concentration, endurance. A good way of motivating and keeping a record of where I am currently at!

Three ball shower with the left hand leading, then the right. Building up the speed and accuracy to be able to get better at 5-ball juggling. My right hand is my strongest and that is the easiest but of course I need to get the left hand better, but not just the left. To get them both better. 

Our house has seriously high ceilings (3.5m) so this is perfect for numbers juggling (yes 5-ball is numbers juggling) and I juggle in front of my bed so the enevitable falls don't fall to the floor and make bang bang bang bang bang for the neighbours below us. And of course its better for myself so that I don't have to keep on bending down to the floor to get the balls. 

I have found some new juggling videos on YouTube to improve my 5-ball technique.

I keep a record on post-it notes of my latest records to see how far I have come and give me motivation to continue. Good fun!

### Currently I am learning:
- 5-ball cascade

- 3-ball shower (L)
- 3-ball shower (R)

### Current Records
- 5-ball cascade (25)
- 3-ball shower with left leading hand (71)
