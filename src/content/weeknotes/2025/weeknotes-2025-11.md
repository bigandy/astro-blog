I am just back from England where I visited family in Berkshire and London and went to my Aunt's 70th Birthday weekend in Norfolk.

## Flight there

Took the bus from Gare Routier in Grenoble to Lyon Saint Exupery then waited an hour before I was able to check in my luggage and go through security before waiting more on the other side. The plane departed late but arrived on time. A very short flight but managed to get fantastic views of night time central London. My Mum picked me up from Heathrow Terminal 3 and drove me to their place where we had a delicious bowl of winter soup for dinner before I crashed exhausted into bed soon after.

## The next morning

I badly needed a haircut but before that I needed to buy a birthday gift for my Aunt, and some food items that we cannot get in France. Then I had my hair cut. A new man! I then went home and had a shower and shave and we were ready to drive to Norfolk for the family weekend.

## Drive Up

I shared driving for the the drive up with Mum and we stopped at Royston for lunch, just next to the place I used to work about 20 years ago.
