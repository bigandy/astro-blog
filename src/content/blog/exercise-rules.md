## Why?

Reasons:

- Feel good;
- Regain the fitness that I have lost over the last six months;
- Grenoble is surrounded by mountains;
- Spring is here;
- Before the heat of the summer arrives I want to get back into shape;
- A habit of exercise is a good force multiplier. If I do this habit well then it knocks on to other aspects of my life. It also makes other habits easier too (I think).

## How?

Every day Monday to Friday I want to do some form of exercise.
Acceptable forms of exercise:

- Zwift 30min+
- Walk for an hour +
- Bike Ride 1 hour +
- Hike in the mountains 1 hour +
- Run 30min+

I shall keep a diary and also keep track of activities on Strava. That way I can look back at the activities that I've done and remark on how many I've done and how far I've come. A motivator! A way of showing off to myself (and to others, but that's not the primary reason).

## Progress so far

I am currently (10th April) into my third week of the exercise routine and I am still adjusting to the massively changed routine. For example this week on Monday I did an hour on Zwift, on Tuesday I did a two-hour bike ride into the Chartreuse mountains, yesterday I did an hour walk and then in the afternoon I cycled with Arthur to his hockey training (40mins). Today I have just done an hour on Zwift.
I think it will be a good idea to have one day off, to give the body some time to relax and rest and recover. It is also a good idea to vary the forms of exercise. And also to vary the intensities that I exercise at.
