Last week was all about:

### French Learning

- Continued learning with Duolingo.

- Bought a copy of Velo magazine which is in French, reading some of daughters book

- Had my try-out first lesson. I can understand a lot, but speaking I find really difficult, confidence and vocabulary being the causes.

- Spent a long weekend in Grenoble with the kids. A beautiful part of the world surrounded by magestic French Alps.

### Exercise

- Did lots of walking while in Grenoble. Went running once with Alistair and Rich (a 10k). Did a Zwift session. No outdoor bike ride.

- Continuing to use the standing desk
