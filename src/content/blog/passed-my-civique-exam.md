I took my Civique Exam in the first week of January and I passed with flying colours!

## What is it?
New this year the civique exam is an additional pre-requisit for getting a multi-year Titre de Sejour in France.

At the end of 2025 I had taken the compulsory four-day Civique Training which was really interesting especially the history of France that I did not already know, as well as some information that I didn't already know about the culture, geography and political landscape of France and Europe.


## Revision

During the course I had made plenty of notes so I went through these again. I also found all the free online tests that I could do and did them over and over. I also read some of the online material on the official [https://formation-civique.interieur.gouv.fr/]. I even read a book on the French Revolution at Marion's parents house over Christmas.


## The Day
Then the day arrived and with it snow on the ground which then turned to smush under the feet and deep puddles and slippery paths and I walked the paths to the exam center in the center of Grenoble. Slush slosh. A passing car sloshed cold water on me but I continued and arrived at the exam center early. I was able to wait and warm up and read through my notes while the time ticked down to the time of the exam.

The exam was fine and I thought I got more wrong that I did. In the end I only got one wrong. So 39/40. I forgot who Josephine Baker was, but got the rest of the questions correct. Whipeee!
