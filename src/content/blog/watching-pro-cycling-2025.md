I took the kids to see their first live cycling race yesterday.

Not their first actually. Arthur was 5 months old when he saw the Tour in Allemond (near Alpe d'huez) in 2015 and both were there when we watched the Tour near La Rochelle in 2018.

But this is the first time they were old enough to appreciate it.

Not the Tour but the Vuelta, started in Italy for the first 3 stages then cycled over from Susa to Voiron for the fourth stage.

We watched on a small climb near the Fort de Comboire - somewhere we've hiked and biked to before.

We parked off the main road near a rubbish dump and hiked up the steep hill and then across to the road where the cyclists were going to cycle.

We found some shade (luxury as it was well above 30C) set up our chairs and waited. Plenty of others were there but not really mega busy. There were plenty of race vehicles and police etc to look at so the time went quickly.

The race arrived after following the GPS dots closely on the Tour Tracker site. First the spanish Guardia, then race vehicles and finally the helicoptor could be seen slowly moving towards us.

In 30 short seconds the riders flew past us and we had to move back from the road as there were too many riders to fit and some were really really close to us.

Then it was over. The straggler solo cyclist and all the many tens of team cars and race related vehicles.

People soon packed up their stuff and drove or cycled or walked away. We were the last people left and we also packed our stuff and walked down the steep hill back to the car and drove home.
