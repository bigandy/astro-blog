Over the last couple of weeks I have become commited to creating some really cool demos in Codepen with CSS. 

I went to CSS Day in Amsterdam at the start of the month and was blown away by the...

<IdeasList ideas={[
    {
        title: "mod()",
        completed: false,
        text: `
        If you want to add some margin after every fourth item with CSS, how would you do that?
        Not possible unless you have some control on the markup, or use nth-child(). But what if you want to do it 
        dynamically? e.g. on...
        
        `
    },
    {
        title: "rem() - aka remainder",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "round()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "min()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "max()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "clamp()",
        completed: false
    },
    ]} />

## rem()

this is called the remainder function and it takes two values 
rem(dividend, divisor). The returned value is the divident divided by the divisor.
The returned value always takes the sign (+ve or -ve) of the dividend.

### Examples
- rem(27,7) = 6
  27 / 7 is 3.8 which is rounded down to 3. 
  Multiplying 3 x 7 gives 21. 
  27 - 21 = 6
  To get the answer we subtract this value
  from the dividend and get 6.

- rem(211, 13) = 4
  211 / 13 = 16.2307692308. 
  16 * 13 = 208
  211 - 208 = 4

- rem(140deg, -90deg) = 50deg
  140 / 90 = 1.5555555556
  1 * 90 = 90
  140 - 90 = 50
