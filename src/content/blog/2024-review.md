Sitting in a lounge chair in the sunshine with blue skies out of the very large windows in front of me I look back on the year 2024 and what it meant to me.

## Highlights

Moving to France in August was most definitely the highlight of the year. We had always wanted to try living in France and I personally wanted to live in the mountains in France so Grenoble matches both of theses criteria. Surrounded by three mountain ranges (Vercors, Belledonne, Chartreuse) and close to many more.

Cycling in stunning scenery around new home in Grenoble.

Hiking with the kids. Every weekend we go somewhere with the kids and go for a family hike.

## Lowlights

Moving to France meant that I had to quit my job. Applying for hundreds of jobs and so far no job.

Mosquitos ([Asian Tiger Mosquito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus)) which are here in Grenoble in summer / autumn (until early November). These are no ordinary mosquitos and go for any exposed skin.
