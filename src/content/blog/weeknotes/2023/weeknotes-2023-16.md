Here's what I got up to last week:

- This year we spent the holiday visiting castles in the Loire valley and Marion's family a further 2 hours south. It was a great time.
- Having spent the last 10 days in France we took the ferry from Caen to Portsmouth. The seas were a bit choppy
- We returned from France on the Bank Holiday Monday and got back home really late at night.
- Exhausted for the next day.
