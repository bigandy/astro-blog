Over the last couple of weeks I have become commited to creating some really cool demos in Codepen with CSS. 

I went to CSS Day in Amsterdam at the start of the month and was blown away by the...

<IdeasList ideas={[

        title: "mod()",
        completed: false,
        text: `
        If you want to add some margin after every fourth item with CSS, how would you do that?
        Not possible unless you have some control on the markup, or use nth-child(). But what if you want to do it 
        dynamically? e.g. on...

    },
    {
        title: "rem() - aka remainder",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "round()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "min()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "max()",
        completed: false
    },
    {

        completed: false
    },
    ]} />

## rem()

this is called the remainder function and it takes two values 
rem(dividend, divisor). The returned value is the divident divided by the divisor.
The returned value always takes the sign (+ve or -ve) of the dividend.

### Examples
- rem(27,7) = 6
  27 / 7 is 3.8 which is rounded down to 3. 
  Multiplying 3 x 7 gives 21. 
  27 - 21 = 6
  To get the answer we subtract this value
  from the dividend and get 6.

- rem(211, 13) = 4
  211 / 13 = 16.2307692308. 
  16 * 13 = 208
  211 - 208 = 4

- rem(140deg, -90deg) = 50deg
  140 / 90 = 1.5555555556
  1 * 90 = 90
  140 - 90 = 50

### Return Value 
- If divisor is 0, the result is NaN.
- If dividend is infinite, the result is NaN.
- If dividend is positive the result is positive (0⁺), and if dividend is negative the result is negative (0⁻).

### Where you would use this

### Differences with mod()


## mod()
this is the modulus function and takes two parameters and returns the 
value of the first parameter divided by the second parameter and the modulus
is the value that is left. The first param is the `dividend` and the second param
is called the `divisor`. The sign of the returned value is always the same as the `divisor`



### Examples
- mod(27, 7) =
27 / 7 = 3.8 which the whole number is then 3
3 * 7 = 21 
27 - 21 = 6

- mod(140deg, -90deg) = -40deg
140 / 90 = -1.5555555556
2 * 90 = 180
140 - 180 = -40

### Return Value
- If divisor is 0, the result is NaN.
- If dividend is infinite, the result is NaN.
- If divisor is positive the result is positive (0⁺), and if divisor is negative the result is negative (0⁻).

### Differences with mod()
mod(dividend, divisor) value always takes the sign of the `divisor`
rem(dividend, divisor) value always takes the sign of the `dividend`
