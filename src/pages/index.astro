  <p>Hello thereðŸ‘‹  I am Andrew and I am a senior front-end software engineer who lives in the UK.</p>

  <p>This is my site and I expect to work on it a lot to get it up to scratch. I've just switched over to using Astro (from 11ty) and so far the experience and end product is top notch.</p>
  <div class="blog-post-list">
  <h2>Latest Blog Posts</h2>
