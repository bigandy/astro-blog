            After upping our lives and moving country to live in Grenoble in
            August we've now been here for five months. I am studying French and
            looking for a new job. Marion started her new job and our children
            started International school. It would be a lie to say that
            everything is perfect but living here in the heart of the french
            alps we have just to look at the horizon or take a short car journey
            and be in the middle of nature.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Currently learning French. I am now having weekly French
            conversation 1-2-1 lessons. Suplementing this is my continued
            Duolingo use. I've just passed 270 days streak. To suppliment this
            further I am also using some textbooks and working through the pages
            and doing the exercises.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been learning how to make various bread-related products
            including bagels and pitta bread. I am next going to start on making
            sourdough bread.
        </p>

        <h2>Side project I am currently working on:</h2>

        <p>
            I am currently working on a couple of connected projects. First of
            all is a next.js app that is powering the API for a React Native app
            that allows me to control my home automation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also getting back into the Chrome Extension development game
            having updated a couple of my extensions and created another one for
            my personal use.
        </p>

        <h2>Reading</h2>

        <p>
            I have just started reading "Foe" by Iain Reid. As well as this I
            have just started listening to "Source Code" by Bill Gates on
            Audible. In the car with the children we are working our way through
            the fourth Harry Potter book "The Goblet of Fire" by J K Rowling.
        </p>

        <h2>Podcasts</h2>

        <p>
            I have just started listening to the "How I Built This with Guy Raz"
            podcast. Further to this I am also listening to different episodes
            of "Whiskey Web and Whatnot", "Syntax", and "Shop Talk". Sprinkled
            between all of these are some random French podcasts that I have
            subscribed to.
        </p>

        <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>
            Zwifting once or twice a week, running once or twice. Yesterday I
            made excellent use of the fantastic weather to do an epic road ride
            with 1500m+ d+ in 82km <ExternalLink
                href="https://www.strava.com/activities/13030100828"
                >"Deeper into the Vercors"</ExternalLink
            >. I have also been doing plenty of walking and on Sunday we went to
            Autrans in the Vercors for our weekly family hike.
        </p>

    <h2>Family<h2>
    <p>
       Our children are in international school here which means they get 4 hours a week in English with the rest being in French. Emma is struggling a lot to settle in, especially to make friends and with the school work. Arthur is finding it easier. Emma does art once a week and Arthur plays hockey. We go hiking in the countryside as a family on Sundays.
