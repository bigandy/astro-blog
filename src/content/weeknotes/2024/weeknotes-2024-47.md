### Exercise

Instead of doing epic bike rides or runs I have concentrated this week on either using Zwift to do a 30 minute session or a flat river-side loop when running. Much more manageable to do!

### French

Just three lessons left of my A2 French course at the Alliance Francaise in Grenoble.

### Weather

Cold then its not, then there is some snow on the mountain peaks around the city, then there is a warm day and its all gone.

### Reading

Reading since last time: I finished reading the excellent "World Without End" by Jancovici - Blain. I then read the last of my birthday books "Mr Geography" by Tim Parks which was pretty good but had a very strange style mixing the past and present. Then I re-commenced reading "An Italian Education" also by Tim Parks, and last week started reading "Le Petit Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. It is in French so progress is super slow because I am having to look up a majority of words but it is satisfying to be able to read at least something in French. Definitely more advanced than my A2 level!
