# Astro: Blog

This site is created using Astro and I am currently using the same markdown files as on my andrewhudson.dev site. Personally I prefer the DX of Astro and I am using both to compare and contrast and perhaps I will swap over to Astro some time in the future. Who knows!

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
