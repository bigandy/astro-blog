Been a mega long time since I last posted and many things have happened. I started a new job, have been to France for 3 weeks in the summer, have been on many excellent escapades on the mountain bike and have read a lot of wonderful books.

Here's what I got up to last week:

- have started reading "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma.

- last night I went [mountain biking with George and Alistair](https://www.strava.com/activities/9984380206) and today I am totally destroyed. I am on the second coffee already.

- I have been studying React in super-fine detail following on with Josh Comeau's fantastic [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) which although I have been a React developer for the last 7 or so years I am learning a ton from.

- Following up from going to London to see my brother and his family for Rob and Megan's joint 40th Birthday Party&trade;
