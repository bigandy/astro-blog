This week I have been learning and practicing wheelies on my mountain bike. I watched all the tutorials on YouTube, borrowed some flat peddles from Alistair, lowered my seatpost and most evenings after work for 15 minutes or so I am outside around on road on my estate practicing wheelies.

Following on from wheelies - still a work in progress - I am also learning how to bunny hop. A skill that is easy to do with clip-in SPD peddles but much more difficult with flat peddles. But yesterday - my first day - I was able to perform so low bunny hops on the pavements and road near where I live.
