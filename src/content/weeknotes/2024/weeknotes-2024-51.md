The best part of last week was the time we spent in Villard de Lans in the Vercors.

## Music I am loving currently
Love the new Michael Kiwanuka album "Small Changes".

As it is december on heavy rotation is the XFM "Its a Cool Cool Christmas" which I found out is 24 years old and I play it every Christmas. A truly excellent collection of Christmas inspired covers.






### Job Search

Still very frustrating at the moment. Applying for jobs.

### Exercise

Was ill for much of this week so didn't do much exercise other than walking to the river and back a few times earlier in the week and hiking and sledging in the snow this last weekend in Villard de Lans.

### French

Have finished my course at Alliance Française and now I am figuring out what to do next. I am thinking that 1-2-1 French lessons focusing on speaking would be much better.

### Weather

Finally a large amount of snow fell on the mountains around Grenoble. Not in town but it was a lot colder here and wetter too.

### Reading

Still reading "Le Petit Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, and half-way through "Intermezzo" by Sally Rooney

### Other

Had friends over for Apéro on Saturday, installed the LED lights in our bedroom.
