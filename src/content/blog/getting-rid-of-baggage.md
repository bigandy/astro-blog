I am deep in the process of getting rid of the leggacy baggage that I have accumulated. Last week I spent a few days getting rid of some of the digital products that I have been using forever, and kept on using because it is easier to keep using something than change and use something else because of all the time you have taken getting used to that thing. The so called [Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/the-sunk-cost-fallacy).

Amongst the apps that fall within the bracket of have used them forever are:

- Dropbox
- Gmail
- Google Drive

## Dropbox

The end of the subscription was fast approaching and I wondered if there was an alternative. I have used Dropbox for 15+ years (since 2010) and while it has been good I wondered if there was an alternative. Doing some research I kept on stumbling on the name Proton so I decided to use that.

Only recently I tried out Proton Mail and have decided to switch over to use that. 

## Google Drive / Google Photos

I have a Pixel phone and initially I had unlimited photo backup with Google Drive and with the rest of the Google ecosystem I was happy to keep using it. But more recently they introduced a maximum of 15GB space (including email/google drive/google photos etc) which I regularly fill up and have to laboriously back up elsewhere when the "your space is running out" emails and online messaging finally annoy me enough. 

## Google Drive






### Proton

Proton is a EU based privacy-first company that has a range of products of which Email, VPN and Cloud storage all fitted right into what I was looking for. Having lived in France since August 2024 I was yet to get a VPN and

### Phone Apps

Went through the apps on my phone and removed all of the apps that I have installed and no longer use.

### Computer Apps

As part of my routine of backing Dropbox to an external HD I needed to download all the files to my computer. Unfortunately there was not enough space on the laptop HD so I used the time to get rid of some stuff on my computer.
