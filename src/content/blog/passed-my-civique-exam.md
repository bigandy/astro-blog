A week into the new year and I took my civique exam. New this year it is a further requirement for getting a Titre de Sejour in France. I had as part of the OFII welcome to France taken a four-day Civique Training so I knew the content but actually passing the exam was another thing to do.

So I found all the free online tests that I could do and did them over and over, plus revising the content covered during the training and also some of the online material that the French Government provided. I even read a BD on the French Revolution at Marion's parents house over Christmas.

Then the day arrived and with it snow on the ground which then turned to smush under the feet and deep puddles and slippery paths and I walked the paths to the exam center in the center of Grenoble.
