It is going to happen! We are moving to Grenoble! Something that we have dreamed of for such a long time is actually going to happen. We are going to live in Grenoble, France from the end of August.

If you don't know Grenoble then I will give you a brief introduction. Grenoble is a French city in the South East of France in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region, the Isere departement, and calls itself the "capital of the Alps". Grenoble is situated on the confluence of two rivers the Isere and the Drac. Surrounded by three mountain ranges: the Chartreuse, the Vercors and the Belledonne ranges. Itself Grenoble is 200m above sea level and one of the flattest cities in France. You can see Mont Blanc one clear days and ski resorts are as near as 15 minutes away.

It all started out in Spring this year when Marion was approached about a job related to her current job, she had some virtual interviews and meetings to get the feel of the role and the company and in May we all went out to Grenoble to get a feel for the city ourselves, for the children. Was this a place that we would like to live? Our only answer was yes.
