Here's what I got up to last week:

- Created a Raycast Extension to assist the creation of new weeknotes. I used it to create this weeknote. I love Raycast.
- Watched a bit of the Chelsea versus Man Utd football
- Zwifted a lot this week. Mon, Tue, Thurs, Saturday. Attempting to banish the winter blues by doing a bit more exercise.
- Was ill on Friday. There was a one day gap between the previous cold and this one. Damn the winter season for colds and illnesses!
- Went for a horrendously muddy and wet mountain bike ride on Sunday with Alistair to the Cheese Shed.
- Watched "Ghosted" and then "Violent Night" over the weekend. Not a great selection of masterpiece films but they were both entertaining.
- Reading "Every Man for Himself and God Against All" by Werner Herzog. A great book so far.
- Have been doing some of the Advent of Code this year again. Some are straightforward and I can crack them, some more time consuming and I can crack them. Now I feel that I have given it a good go and get on with my life. There is not enough time for this puzzle with a family, a job and the exercise I want to be doing. Something has to give and it is the AOC that I am willing to stop. Good fun though!
