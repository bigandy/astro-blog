I am currently on the lookout for a new code editor. But why???

First of all I saw the was a new code editor called <ExternalLink href="https://zed.dev">Zed</ExternalLink> so I decided to give it a full try.

I have a list of miniumum features that I require when I look for a new code editor and here they are:

1. Integrated Terminal (less windows to flip between the better, especially on one screen)
2. Syntax highlighting
3.



things


## VS Code
<PositiveList>
    <li>really easy to find an extension</li>
    <li>has all the possible configuration options</li>
    <li>have used it for many years since leaving Sublime Text 3 behind</li>
</PositiveList>

<NegativeList>
    <li>Slow</li>
    <li>Getting in the way of the writing or coding experience</li>
    <li>Too many options</li>
</NegativeList>

## Zed
<PositiveList>
    <li>Super fast</li>
    <li>Don't even realise you are using a code editor.</li>
</PositiveList>

<NegativeList>
    <li>Extensions are slim pickings</li>
</NegativeList>
