I am super keen to re-start these weeknotes. So here goes!


It was the the first week of Autumn and the weather really dropped significantly compared to the previous week. On Monday the weather was 14ºC whereas the previous Saturday was 29ºC. Wowzers! 

Highlights of the week include: 

- Emma continues here cycling journey. She has been learning for about a month now. 
    She has progressed from the single speed small wheeled blue bike to the bigger green bike with gears and bigger wheels. This means she can go further and thus we all can go further! 
    
    On Sunday we did the 23km (double her last furthest distance!) loop.

    Starting through town and then along the Isère to the hydro-electric dam and then back along the other side of the Isère and finally the Drac. 

- Sportball and Pro cycling watching:
  On Saturday we watched England win the Rugby Womens World Cup on Saturday afternoon. 
  On Sunday 


## Exercise
- Ran Two times. Solo on Wednesday and then on Friday lunchtime with Marion.
- Walked twice which is less than the previous week. I am still trying to find a balance between too much and not enough.
- Family Cycle ride on Sunday.


## Reading
- Reading "Le Club des Cinq - et le trésor de l'île" by Enid Blyton (based on the original by Enid Blyton and transferred to France). Yes I am looking up a lot of the words but I am finding that if I record a list of the words and look them up at the end is a lot better than looking up at the time I record them. Hopefully I will learn more vocabulary at the same time! 

- Reading "Gullivers Travels" by Jonathan Swift. Published in 1726 it is quite a challenge at times to decipher what is being said. I enjoyed the first half but now have reached a point that I just want to finish the book.
