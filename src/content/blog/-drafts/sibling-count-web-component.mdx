I have been fascinated with the ability in CSS to know the current index of a sibling element. That is to know if I am the fifth child of a parent element. This is a feature that is not available in CSS, but it is something that I have been wanting to use for a while. I have been working on a project where I needed to know the index of a sibling element, and I found a way to do it using a web component.


### Lessons learned

During the process of creating this web component I learned a few things:

- How to create a web component
- How to test a web component
- Make decisions based on real-life useage 
- Deployments of new versions to npm using Github Actions
- Automation of linting / testing with Github Actions
- Conversion of web component code into Typescript
- MutationObserver to monitor changes to the slot so that the sibling count is updated
- Updating the component to match the newly released prototype in Chrome Canary and thinking whether I should feature detect the support for sibling-count() or not.
