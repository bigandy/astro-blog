    Hi there! I'm Andrew and I'm a software engineer. I live in Wallingford, UK
    with my wife and two kids. I love running (the muddier and the further the
    better), reading and learning, watching the cycling on TV and going on long
    country walks, playing with the kids, and seeing family.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my day job as a software engineer at Venture Harbour I do many different
    things including React, Electron, Chrome Extension, Node, CI setup,
    performance, as well as CSS and HTML and vanilla JS.
