Writing is so difficult so I have to get past the difficult stage to where it becomes an easier thing. So to get past the difficult stage I need to write. Writing what I have done over the last week is a good thing for the fingers and the mind and some content for the blog so here goes.

I have made the monumental descision to do some exercise every day of the week. Recently I found that I was feeling shit for not having a job and being inside most of the time has re-inforced this bad feeling so to get out of the bad feeling loop I set myself the task of doing some exercise every day. <Lot of writing, delete most of it!>

Monday I remembered that I still have an active Zwift subscription and set about using it doing a course that I have not completed and getting some XP and excercise down.

Tuesday I remembered that I felt good on Monday after doing some exercise and also did some Zwifting, another different course on Zwift. I also went for a short walk to the park, sat in the outdoors fresh air. Pure bliss. Spring is here and lots of flowers out that you would only get in flower shops or put in pots in the UK.

Wednesday I used my Genesis steel framed compact-gear-lacking beast and decided that it was a good idea to do a two hour circuit of hell. The slopes were so difficult and painful but I made it up them and enjoyed the ride, expecially the views of the mountains and the downhills were fast and furious. In the afternoon I walked with Arthur to his hockey and did a further walk from there.

Thursday I walked up Bastille and in the evening Marion and I cycled to a Bistro in the evening for a date night.

Friday is today I will cycle to meet Marion and go for a run from her work.
