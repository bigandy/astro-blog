## Routine

Having a routine is an extremely important part of getting a job. Every day do these things and life will be a hell of a lot easier and I will feel good about it all.

1. Exercise at least 30 minutes on the Zwift Turbo trainer. No excuses. Can be easy, brutal, or anywhere in between.

2. Apply for at minimum one job per day. This keeps the momentum going.

3. Avoid distractions. Easier said than done but worth it. Log out of instagram/Mastodon etc and make it difficult to access these kinds of distractions. Set up a block in place of self policiing.
