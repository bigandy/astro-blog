First year living in France and it is very strange because in Grenoble where we live the schools are still not on holiday and today is Good Friday. 

France schools are split into three Zones and which zone you are in is the basis for when your holidays are taken. This is true for the Winter Holiday (February for two weeks) and also for Easter (April / May for two weeks). 

### Easter Holidays - aka Vacances de printemps 
- Zone A (which Grenoble is in): 19 April - 5 May
- Zone B is: 5 April - 22 Avril
- Zone C is: 12 April - 28 April

The idea behind it is so that everyone in the country is not on holiday at the same time and not block the resorts, beaches, ski resorts, etc at the same time. 

To me as a expat here feels very strange.
