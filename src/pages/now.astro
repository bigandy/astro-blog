		<h2>Life</h2>
		<p>Had a summer holiday in the French Alps, now back at work before the long weekend at the end of August. I have just started a new job and that is going quite well so far.</p>

		<p>For New Year we rented a holiday cottage in West Wittering with my side of the family. Much food was eaten and rest was had. On New Years Day we had a swim in the sea.</p>

		<h2>Learning</h2>
		<p>Over the Christmas break I managed to do a lot of reading ("The Manager's Path" and started "Staff Engineer"), plus some coding. I am interested lately in learning about React Native so I am working my way through a course on Frontend Masters. On the CSS front I am fascinated by all of the new CSS features that are coming especially container queries.</p>

		<h2>Fitness</h2>
		<p>Walking and Mountain Biking. Had a hietus away from Zwift but now that September is coming I think I will start doing that again. Trying to get out walking during the day, a few times to break up the day and to get some fresh air and let the mind wander away from the keyboard</p>

		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>It was great to spend lots of time with the family over Christmas. Arthur continues to love Lego, solving puzzles and is very creative. Emma is developing rapidly and has a very strong (stubborn) personality, and Emma loves unicorns, princesses and making house, and drawing. Both Arthur and Emma love playing together which is great too. Marion has been super busy with her job and does a fair bit of running.</p>
