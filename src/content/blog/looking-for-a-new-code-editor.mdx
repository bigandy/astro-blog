I am currently on the lookout for a new code editor. But why???

1. Bored of VS Code. With the autocompletes and the blobs of shit all over the place it has become an eyesaw and something I hate to use. I feel that it gets in the way of what I want to be doing which is coding and creating wonderful shit.

2. My code editor journey has been this: Microsoft Front-page > DreamWeaver > Notepad++ > Sublime Text 2 > Atom > Sublime Text 3 > VS Code > Zed. Looking back on this list my favorite editor was Sublime Text 3. Why? Because it was lightweight, did what I wanted it to and no more. I could use a seperate terminal and create some funky websites. It was perfect.

3. God I am bored of VS Code. Sure it does everything you need of a code editor but fuck it is totally goddamn boring. And it gets in the way of what I want to be doing: Coding;

First of all I saw the was a new code editor called <ExternalLink href="https://zed.dev">Zed</ExternalLink> so I decided to give it a full try.

## What am I looking for in a new code editor?

I have a list of miniumum features that I require when I look for a new code editor and here they are:

1. Integrated Terminal (less windows to flip between the better, especially on one screen)
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Search by text
4. Extensions
5. AI Assistance
6. Customisability - i.e. font-size, hide folders
7. Project specific settings i.e. different font-sizes if on a writing project versus a coding project.
8. Favorite Projects

## VS Code

<PositiveList>
    <li>really easy to find an extension</li>
    <li>has all the possible configuration options</li>
    <li>have used it for many years since leaving Sublime Text 3 behind</li>
</PositiveList>

<NegativeList>
    <li>Slow</li>
    <li>Getting in the way of the writing or coding experience</li>
    <li>Too many options</li>
</NegativeList>

## Zed

<PositiveList>
    <li>Super fast</li>
    <li>Don't even realise you are using a code editor.</li>

<NegativeList>
    <li>Extensions are slim pickings</li>
    <li>Search over multiple lines is a bit shit so far</li>
</NegativeList>
