I wanted to make it more difficult to use distracting websites<a href="#target-1" id="src-1"><sup>*</sup></a> so I decided to clear the cookies of these sites when I closed Chrome.

## How to do this

- go to chrome://settings/content/siteData
- in the default behaviour choose to "Delete data sites that have been saved to your device when you close all windows"
- opt-in to the sites you want to keep. Currently I only have a few of these including Github, Codepen and Gmail. Everything else is deleted when I close Chrome.

(Alternatively you can black-list sites you don't want to save and set the default to "Allow sites to save data on your device".)

<div data-mark id="target-1"><a href="#src-1"><sup>*</sup> distracting websites such as: Facebook, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Mastodon</div>
