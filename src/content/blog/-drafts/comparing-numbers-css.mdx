Over the last couple of weeks I have become commited to creating some really cool demos in Codepen with CSS. 

I went to CSS Day in Amsterdam at the start of the month and was blown away by the...

<IdeasList ideas={[
    {
        title: "round()",
        completed: false,
        text: `
        If you want to add some margin after every fourth item with CSS, how would you do that?
        Not possible unless you have some control on the markup, or use nth-child(). But what if you want to do it 
        dynamically? e.g. on...
        
        `
    },
    {
        title: "mod()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "min()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "max()",
        completed: false
    },
    {
        title: "clamp()",
        completed: false
    },
    ]} />
