# Astro: andrewhudson.dev

This site is created using Astro and I am currently using the same markdown files as on my 11ty site (a simple copy-paste of the markdown from one to the other works). I prefer the DX of Astro and I am using Astro as my default Framework for content based sites!

## Styling of Code Blocks

see the file `ec.config.mjs`

options here: https://expressive-code.com/key-features/code-component/#usage-in-astro-files

## Current Content

### Bookshelf

I am tracking my reading habits in a Notion Database and grabbing the content from that - via the Notion API - each time the site is built.

### Weeknotes

Sometimes I will write a weeknote but feels less often than when I started writing them. Who knows if they will continue on the site or not. To be Decided!

### Blog

Non-weeknote content. Can be random posts, or more in-depth.

### CV

I tried keeping a seperate repository but seems like its simpler to keep it here as I'm hosting the cv on this domain anyway.

## Re-write

### Inspiration

I am really digging the style of https://maggieappleton.com/now so this could be something that I use going forwards for my now page
