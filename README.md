# Astro: andrewhudson.dev

This site is created using Astro and I am currently using the same markdown files as on my 11ty site (a simple copy-paste of the markdown from one to the other works). I prefer the DX of Astro and I am using Astro as my default Framework for content based sites!

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command              | Action                                              |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`        | Installs dependencies                               |
| `npm run dev`        | Starts local dev server at `localhost:8888`         |
| `npm run dev --open` | Starts local dev server and opens in defult browser |

## Current Content

### Bookshelf

I am tracking my reading habits in a Notion Database and grabbing the content from that - via the Notion API - each time the site is built.

### Weeknotes

Sometimes I will write a weeknote but feels less often than when I started writing them. Who knows if they will continue on the site or not. To be Decided!

### Blog

Non-weeknote content. Can be random posts, or more in-depth.

### CV

I tried keeping a seperate repository but seems like its simpler to keep it here as I'm hosting the cv on this domain anyway.

## Re-write

### Inspiration

https://nazhamid.com/journal/

I am really digging the style of https://maggieappleton.com/now so this could be something that I use going forwards for my now page
