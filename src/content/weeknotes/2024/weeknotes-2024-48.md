The best part of last week was most definitely when we went to Chamrousse 1650 - our local ski resort - where there was lots of snow, and we played all day in it. The kids were extremely happy: Emma made a snowman and Arthur, Emma, Marion and I played for hours taboganing on the sled that we had brought with us.

### Job Search

Very frustrating at the moment. I am applying for many jobs but no word back either successful or not. I guess a lot of people are in the same situation with the tech scene but does not make it easier.

### Exercise

I did three sessions on Zwift. A ski hike with the kids and a bike ride with Marion.

### French

Just two lessons left of my A2 French course at the Alliance Francaise in Grenoble.

### Weather

The first part of the week it was very cold with snow on the mountains. Yesterday and today have been really warm (18&deg;C) and very windy.

### Reading

Reading since last time: I am continuing to read "An Italian Education" by Tim Parks, and also reading "Le Petit Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

### Other

Had friends over for Apéro on Saturday, installed the LED lights in our bedroom.
