# Astro-blog

Please find the source code for my Astro site which is currently located online at [andrewhudson.dev](https://andrewhudson.dev/)

I am currently using this site to publish articles about web development, about my life, and also as somewhere to experiment with some ideas around new web technologies when I have the time.

I am keeping track of my reading habits on the /bookshelf page, what I am doing /now and also a /weeknotes area of the site.

## Developing

- `npm run dev` starts the dev server on port 8888
- `npm run dev -- --open` starts the dev server and opens the site in the default web browser
- `npm run build` creates a built version of the site
- `npm run preview` runs the built version of the site. Make sure to run `npm run build` first!
